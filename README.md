## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install dependencies and the package globally (or in your virtual environment):

```bash
pip install --editable .
```

This installs all required dependencies automatically, including `InquirerPy`, `PyYAML`, and `Rich`.

3. Ensure your Python user scripts directory (e.g., `~/.local/bin` or `%APPDATA%\Python\Scripts`) is in your system `PATH` so you can run `tracklet` from the command line.

## Usage

tracklet project init
tracklet task create
tracklet deliverable list

### Detailed Command and Examples

#### Initialize a project (defaults to current directory and directory name as project name)

```bash
tracklet init --name "My Project"
```

#### or simply

```bash
tracklet init
```

- Prompts for all metadata interactively.
- Prevents duplicate initialization (warns if already initialized).
- Use --force to overwrite existing metadata if needed.

#### Update project metadata and progress

Update any combination of project properties:

```bash
tracklet update --stage "Development"  --tag -a "backend,api" --author "Alice"
```

- Supports adding, removing, or replacing tags:  
  - Replace tags: `--tag "tag1,tag2"`  
  - Add tags: `--tag -a "tag3"`  
  - Remove tags: `--tag -r "tag1"`  
- Interactive prompts with autocomplete appear if flags are used without values.
- Works inside project directories or from main directory with project selection prompt.

---

#### Search projects by tag, stage, author, or description

```bash
tracklet search --tag react-native
tracklet search --stage "Development"
tracklet search --author "Alice"
```

- Supports include and exclude filters.
- Interactive filter builder if no flags are provided.
- Displays results in a rich, color-coded table.

---

#### List all projects and folders in a directory

```bash
tracklet list
```

#### or specify a directory

```bash
tracklet list /path/to/projects
```

- Lists immediate subfolders.
- Indicates which folders are initialized projects.
- Shows tags, stages, and other metadata in detailed mode (`--detailed`).

---

#### Uninitialize a project

Remove Tracklet metadata from the current project directory:

```bash
tracklet uninit
```

- Prompts for confirmation unless `--force` is used.

## üß© Extending

-Add rules to rules/operations/ for automated actions
-Modify metadata in .projectmeta
-Customize prompts in tracklet/utils/prompt.py

## Unistallation

To uninstall Tracklet from your environment, run:

```bash
pip uninstall tracklet
```

This removes the package and its CLI command from your system.

To remove build artifacts, caches, and metadata after unistalling, run:

```bach
python scripts/clean.py
```

This will remove `__pycache__`, `.egg-info`, build folders, and other common leftovers.

## Project Stages

Tracklet uses the following predefined stages for project progress tracking:

- Planning
- Development
- Staging
- Testing
- Production
- Abandoned
- On Hold
